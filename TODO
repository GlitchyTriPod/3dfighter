- UPDATE character controller
    - movement should be relative to position to opponent
    - inputs need to be taken using multiple levels of interpretation
        - read inputs from player 1 controller
        - read inputs from player 2 controller
        - inputs are read, they must be interpreted based on camera position on local client end
            - inputs are then sent to proper character controller
        - inputs are read on chara_controller level
        - based on character moveset, movement and attacks are performed
            - in coordination with camera position !!!!!
