- make collision shape follow armature
- base floor detection off of root bone position
    - base all collision detection off of float positions -- convert to int64 before calc
- update collide_and_slide to update root bone position instead of collision shape
- update animation library to have basic root motion
    - pre bake animations
- check if this shit work !!!!!!!

0. check if player is in control of character position
1. animation dictates character mesh position
2. update collision shape to match mesh position
3. check collisions, update collision shape position
4. re-update mesh position to match collision shape
5. rotate mesh to match collision shape
